1. About
	1.1 Overview
		Cirrus is intended to allow users to automatically scale a service running on a virtualization substrate. The approach is "driver" based so that various virtualization technologies can be managed and multiple applications can be monitored from a single point. The main difference between Cirrus and other projects is that it aims to monitor a service running in the cloud  and provide it the resources it needs and also aims to tie systems management into the equation.

| Apache | <---- Cirrus ----> | Virtualization Manager |
	          \--"Hey, give Apache more resources"

	1.2 Directory Structure
		/bin/ - Control Scripts
		/conf/ - Configuration Files
		/drivers/ - Drivers for substrates (virtualization, systems management, etc)
		/drivers/conf - Driver Specific Configuration
		/log/ - Log files
	1.3 Cirrus.sh
		/bin/Cirrus.sh is used to add virtual machines and remove virtual machines from a private cloud.
	1.4 Requirements
		The following are required

2. Installation
	2.1 Obtain the latest source
		http://github.com/jameslabocki/Cirrus
	2.2 Unpack
		`tar -xvzf Cirrus-archive.tar.gz`
		`unzip Cirrus-archive.zip`

3. Configuration
	3.1 CirrusVmList
		The CirrusVmList is a csv file located in the global configuration directory (./conf) with the following attributes

		Service Name, Virtual Machine Name, IP Address, MAC Address, Technologies in Use

		For example:

		-- Arbitrary Service Name
		|	-- Virtual Machine Name
		|	|		-- IP Address
		|	|		|		-- MAC Address
		|	|		|		|	    -- Call RHEV Driver
		|	|		|		|	    |   -- Call Satellite Action
		|	|		|		|	    |	|
		mrggrid,mrgexec19,172.20.128.128,00:1A:4A:14:80:CD,rhev,satellite

		It is important to populate this file with entries for each service you wish to scale.
